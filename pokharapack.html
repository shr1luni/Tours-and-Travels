        <h3>Trip Overview</h3>
        <p>Classic Nepal: 3 days Nepal Tour is a short holiday trip to Nepal. The primary purpose of this journey is to explore Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal. Kathmandu is famous as the town of the fascinating cultural heritage. Most of the glorious heritages inside Kathmandu valley were constructed before 18th centuries in a unique design.

          Nepal Tour 2 nights 3 days begins by traveling in Thamel, the tourist center of Kathmandu city with many souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes, and bars. Next day our professional guide takes you on the cultural tour of Boudhanath, Pashupatinath and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. UNESCO, a sister organization of the United Nations, have approved these three places are the World Heritage Sites.
          
          Boudhanath is the largest Buddha temple in Nepal. It is also the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet. Walking around this temple makes you feel you are traveling somewhere in Tibetâ€™s holy place. Likewise, Pashupatinath is one of the holiest Shiva temples on the earth. Here you see many Shiva temples, meet many Hindu Sages with their unique dress and styles. The open fire cremation in the bank of the Bagmati River gives an extra impression to all.
          
          Similarly, Bhaktapur is the oldest city in the Kathmandu valley. It has the artistic palace, temples and different monuments built before the 18th century. This city is like an open museum for the typical culture and lifestyle of Newar people, the indigenous group of Kathmandu valley.
          
          On the final day, the farewell dinner at the typical Nepali restaurant with a live show of cultural dances makes this tour more exciting and memorable.</p>
